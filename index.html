                <p class="paraHeader">Appearance</p>
                <p>
                    The red panda is slightly larger than a domestic cat with a bear-like body, thick fur and long sharp claws used for climbing trees. Usually, they are about 2 feet in length and are on average, about 9-13 pounds (5-6 kg).
                    The belly and limbs are black, and there are white markings on the side of the head and above its eyes. In the winter they will sometimes cover themselves with their tail to stay warm. They are the only members of the
                    Ailuridae family.

                <p class="paraHeader">Diet</p>
                <p>
                    About 85-95% of a red panda's diet is bamboo, but sometimes they will eat fruit, insects, bird eggs and small lizards. They have a carnivour-like stomach and are classified as carnivours, even though them eating things
                    other then bamboo is rare. They adapted to have flattened teeth and strong chewing muscles to make it easier to eat bamboo.

                <p class="paraHeader">Habitat</p>
                <p>
                    Red pandas live in high altitudes in the Eastern Himalayas in places like China, Bhutan and India. They spend a lot of their time in trees and prefer habitats with many trees and bamboo plants and in India, they
                    sometimes live in tropical forests. Their claws help them move easily from branch to branch.

                <p class="paraHeader">Communication</p>
                <p>
                    They can use squeaks, hisses, growls, barks and other sounds to communicate, adults tend to use high-frequency twitters and newborns tend to use high-pitched whistles. Other forms of communication include scent and
                    staring at each other.

                <p class="paraHeader">Endangered</p>
                <p>
                    Red pandas sadly are endangered. Much of their endangerment is due to loss of habitat, and there are only an estimated 10,000 left although some estimates say only 2,500 and the population is believed to have decreased
                    around 50% over the last 18 years. Many people are doing things to try and prevent their extinction and many countries are imposing laws to protect them.
